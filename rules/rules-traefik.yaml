# Auto-generated set of falco rules for traefik containers
# Generated at 2018-05-23 11:57:36 UTC

# By default, the autogenerated rules include rules that attempt to
# restrict the set of system calls that can be performed by
# applications. However, we know that these rules are fairly FP-prone,
# so they are disabled by default. If you'd like to enable them,
# either change or override this macro's condition to "evt.num >= 0".
- macro: traefik_consider_syscalls
  condition: (evt.num < 0)

# These policies are limited to containers, specifically those where
# the container image name starts with "traefik"
- macro: app_traefik
  condition: container and container.image contains "traefik"

# Not considering all inbound networking suspect


# Restricting listening ports to selected set

- list: traefik_allowed_inbound_ports_tcp
  items: [443, 80, 8080]

- rule: Unexpected inbound tcp connection traefik
  desc: Detect inbound traffic to traefik using tcp on a port outside of expected set
  condition: inbound and evt.rawres >= 0 and not fd.sport in (traefik_allowed_inbound_ports_tcp) and app_traefik

# Restricting spawned processes to selected set

# Restricting files read or written to specific set
- rule: Unauthorized process opened an outbound connection (traefik)
  desc: A traefik process tried to open an outbound connection and is not whitelisted
  condition: outbound and app_traefik and not proc.name in (traefik_allowed_processes)
