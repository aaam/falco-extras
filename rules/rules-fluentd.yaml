# Auto-generated set of falco rules for fluentd containers
# Generated at 2018-05-23 14:30:19 UTC

# By default, the autogenerated rules include rules that attempt to
# restrict the set of system calls that can be performed by
# applications. However, we know that these rules are fairly FP-prone,
# so they are disabled by default. If you'd like to enable them,
# either change or override this macro's condition to "evt.num >= 0".
- macro: fluentd_consider_syscalls
  condition: (evt.num < 0)

# These policies are limited to containers, specifically those where
# the container image name starts with "fluentd"
- macro: app_fluentd
  condition: container and container.image contains "fluentd"

# Not considering all inbound networking suspect

# Not considering all outbound networking suspect

# Restricting listening ports to selected set

- list: fluentd_allowed_inbound_ports_tcp
  items: [31337]

- rule: Unexpected inbound tcp connection fluentd
  desc: Detect inbound traffic to fluentd using tcp on a port outside of expected set
  condition: inbound and evt.rawres >= 0 and not fd.sport in (fluentd_allowed_inbound_ports_tcp) and app_fluentd
  output: Inbound network connection to fluentd on unexpected port (command=%proc.cmdline pid=%proc.pid connection=%fd.name sport=%fd.sport user=%user.name %container.info image=%container.image)

- rule: Unexpected spawned process fluentd
  desc: Detect a process started in a fluentd container outside of an expected set
  condition: spawned_process and not proc.name in (fluentd_allowed_processes) and app_fluentd

- rule: Unexpected file access readwrite for fluentd
  desc: Detect an attempt to access a file readwrite other than below an expected list of directories
  condition: (open_write) and not fd.name pmatch (fluentd_allowed_file_prefixes_readwrite) and app_fluentd
